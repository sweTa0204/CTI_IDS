# Archive - Old Work Reference

**Archived Date**: 2026-01-28

This folder contains all old work that has been archived for reference. The project is being retrained with proper methodology.

## Contents

| Folder | Original | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `old_fresh_training/` | `03_model_training/fresh_training/` | Previous model training (wrong data source) |
| `old_02_feature_engineering/` | `02_feature_engineering/` | Old feature engineering scripts |
| `old_04_validation_results/` | `04_validation_results/` | Old validation results |
| `old_05_documentation/` | `05_documentation/` | Old documentation |
| `old_06_xai_integration/` | `06_xai_integration/` | XAI work (SHAP/LIME) - to be reused later |
| `old_07_report_generation/` | `07_report_generation/` | Old report generation |
| `old_08_archive/` | `08_archive/` | Previous archive |
| `old_09_references/` | `09_references/` | Reference materials |
| `old_10_csic_challenge/` | `10_csic_challenge/` | CSIC challenge materials |
| `old_presentation_figures/` | `presentation_figures/` | Old presentation figures |

## Why Archived?

The original training was done on data from the wrong source (Kaggle had swapped training/testing set names). We are now retraining with:

1. **Proper Training Data**: Official UNSW-NB15 Training Set (175,341 records)
2. **Proper Testing Data**: Official UNSW-NB15 Testing Set (82,332 records)
3. **Better Methodology**: Stratified sampling by protocol

## Reference Use

- XAI integration code can be reused after new models are trained
- Feature engineering scripts can be referenced for methodology
- Documentation provides context for the research
