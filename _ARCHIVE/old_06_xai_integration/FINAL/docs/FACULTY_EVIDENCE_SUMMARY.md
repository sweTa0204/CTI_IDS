|-----------------|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| 🏆 **Random Forest + SHAP** | **93.1/100** | **#1** | Perfect explanation quality (100%) |
| 🥈 XGBoost + SHAP | 91.2/100 | #2 | Highest model accuracy (95.5%) |
| 🥉 XGBoost + LIME | 91.2/100 | #3 | Model-agnostic flexibility |
| 🏃 Random Forest + LIME | 90.1/100 | #4 | Good but lower theoretical foundation |

### **Scoring Framework (Transparent & Justifiable):**
```
🎯 Model Performance (40%): How accurate is the model?
📊 Explanation Quality (30%): How reliable are the explanations?
🔬 Method Foundation (20%): How strong is the theoretical basis?
🚀 Production Readiness (10%): How deployable is the solution?
```
