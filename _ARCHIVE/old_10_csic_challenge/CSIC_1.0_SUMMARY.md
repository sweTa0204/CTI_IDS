## ⭐ RELEVANT TRACK: Systems & Software Security - DDoS Mitigation System

### Problem Statement Description
> Develop a machine learning based DDoS mitigation system capable of distinguishing legitimate traffic spikes from malicious floods, providing adaptive and automated defenses against hyper volumetric attacks.

### Exact Deliverables Required

1. **Traffic Shaping Proxy** - Implementation with fast BPF filters and auto signature generation
2. **ML-based Anomaly Detection Module** - Differentiate real traffic surges from attacks
3. **Simulation Framework** - Test floods and chart mitigation latency vs. packet-rate peaks
4. **Comparative Benchmarking Report** - vs. traditional appliance-based solutions

### Development Phases/Milestones

| Phase | Deliverable |
|-------|-------------|
| Phase 1 | Implement baseline traffic anomaly detection |
| Phase 2 | Add ML-based classification for attack vs. legitimate surges |
| Phase 3 | Deploy traffic shaping proxy and validate on large, simulated floods |

### Additional Requirements
- Focus on **real-time mitigation capabilities**
- **Lightweight ML models** preferred for high-speed packet filtering
- Benchmarking against attack scales relevant to **India's internet exchanges**
